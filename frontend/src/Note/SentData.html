When to Use Which Option
Use static: true:

When you need to perform actions in ngOnInit that require the child element.
If the element you are querying is guaranteed to be present in the template when the component initializes.

Use static: false:

When the child element is created conditionally (e.g., inside an *ngIf).
If the reference might not be available immediately during component initialization.




Both [set] and [update] will trigger change detection and update the view when using ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush.
Performance:
If you are frequently changing values or need to maintain complex states, using update may provide a more efficient and
less error-prone way to manage state changes.
set is straightforward for replacing entire states, while update is ideal for modifying existing states.
Conclusion
Use set when you want to replace the signal value completely and you know the new state.
Use update when you want to modify the current signal value based on its existing state, which may be more expressive
and lead to clearer code in some cases.
